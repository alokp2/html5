Canvas and SVG tags 

The Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based image format that is used to define two-dimensional 
vector-based graphics for the web. Unlike raster image (Ex .jpg, .gif, .png, etc.), a vector image can be scaled up 
or down to any extent without losing the image quality.

 The canvas element is only a container for graphics. 
You must use a script to actually draw the graphics. Canvas has several 
methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.
